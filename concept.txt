fictional historical figure generator.

so we need a bank of names, a wide variety of accomplishments, and the ability to generate random dates that
they happened.

example. Louis the Conquerer (1492 - 2004) was the king of Yugoslavia. He had five dogs.

[generate random accomplishments within the date range of his life]
[first one should be where they were born, last is how they died]
1492: born in Sicily
1507: Defeated the spanish armada
1706: Erected monument to himself in Guam
2004: died peacefully in bed

ok so we need banks of things. things we need include:
-names. first names & last names or alternately titles.
-date generator. generates dates within a reasonable human lifespan.
-jobs. why are they noteable? were they monarchs or artists or officials in some other capacity?
-places. countries probably, maybe cities.
-things they did, maybe sorted by job?
-causes of death.
